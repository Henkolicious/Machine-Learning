<h2>Question part 1:</h2>
<p>Let X1, X2 and X3 be the three different vectors and each one has 6 samples. Find the
correlations between the variable vectors: X1 and X2, X1 and X3, X2 and X3 using correlation
coefficient approach. The sample values of three vectors are given as</p>
<p>X1 = {2.5, 3.6, 1.2, 0.8, 4.0, 3.4},</p>
<p>X2 = {1.2, 1.0, 1.8, 0.9, 3.0, 2.2},</p>
<p>X3 = {8.0, 15.0, 12.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0}</p>

<h2>Question part 2:</h2>
<p>k nearest neighbour (called X) has been used to estimate the price of the houses based on
three different variables which are the number of rooms, size of house in m2, and age of
houses. The training set is given below which is used to train the algorithm. Use the test
dataset to estimate the price of the houses based on the k nearest neighbour algorithm (for
k=1 and k=2).</p>
